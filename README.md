Experimenting with writing a game as my first proper code

Will code a program to play with, including easy (always loses), impossible (always wins) and equal (random choice)
This will have minimal UI, but once I have the code down I will try to design a more fancy and intuitive structure

rps is a Jupyter notebook that I started with, however I realized this is not a straight python file that I was hoping it to be. So I made rpsser (standing for rps serious) as a raw python file to continue my work as a "proper" python file. The end goal is to export rpsser as a standalone .exe for anyone to open and use

The dist folder has the previous standalone program that opens in terminal for user input, as well as the updated GUI export (RPS) that is free for anyone to use! But I do not have an official certificate to sign them so both are still seen as possibly risky software unfortunately
